# Fish_model
I have built a ML model for the Fish market dataset - A Database of common fish species for fish market model.
The Fish Market dataset is a dataset that has 7 types of data, namely: Species, Weight, Length 1, Length 2, Length 3, Height, Width and has 160 data entries. 
Heroku's deployment of an ML model
To predict the type of fish based on parameters like weight, length, height, and width, a random classifier model is created for the fish dataset.
A model.pk file was used to save the model.
To host the model on the local machine i used flask.
An html folder was created for the front page of the web page 
A css file was also created to create a user friendly webpage.
Heroku was the platform used to host the application online. 
To host the application online in Heroku, we need to connect to our Github repo and give give heroku the authority to deploy the branch where all the fishmodel files are kept.
The build was successful in Heroku
